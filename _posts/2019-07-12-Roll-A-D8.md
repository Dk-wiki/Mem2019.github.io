## 0x00 Overview

This is a [challenge](https://ctftime.org/task/6081) from Plaid CTF 2018, and is also a real world vulnerability. The vulnerability is an improper array length setting in `GenerateSetLength`, so the length of array (e.i. `array.length`) can be higher than real length, which can cause array OOB read and write. We can allocate an `ArrayBuffer` object behind the OOB array, read `kBackingStoreOffset` pointer to leak heap address, and write `kBackingStoreOffset` pointer to achieve arbitrary memory read and write. Finally we can use normal `libc` exploitation technique to achieve code execution.

## 0x01 Preparation

Firstly, we need to get the source code of V8. The articles I have read are [this](http://eternalsakura13.com/2018/05/06/v8/) and [this](http://eternalsakura13.com/2018/06/26/v8_environment/) (in Chinese), but there are also resources online so I will not cover this part in detail. the hash of commit with vulnerability is `1dab065bb4025bdd663ba12e2e976c34c3fa6599`, therefore we use the following command to switch to the vulnerable commit.

```
git reset --hard 1dab065bb4025bdd663ba12e2e976c34c3fa6599
gclient sync
```

Then we can use this to compile the release version of V8 engine:

```
tools/dev/v8gen.py x64.relase
ninja -C out.gn/x64.relase d8
```

So that we can use the `d8` in this way:

```

```
